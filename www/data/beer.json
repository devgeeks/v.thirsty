The Monks' Wit uses the same ingredients but uses only two hops and one malted barley. It also has red wheat, white wheat, flaked oats, bitter orange peel, sweet orange peel, coriander, and another spice. For this beer, all the ingredients and sources are approved by the FDA.

I love pairing the two together, but I wonder about the point of pushing the envelope too much with \"novel\" brewing ingredients. Other than the occasional recipe which uses honey, I can't think of any other animal product which we use in the production of our beer.\r\n \r\nWe try to keep our recipes and process streamlined to avoid any unnecessary complexity, such as processing aids. This gives us the best degree of control over the flavor of our beer.\r\n \r\nI've used isinglass finings at other breweries, but we don't utilize that here and have no intention of doing so, even with our cask beer.\"\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your response.

The most recent one we did was the 15th Anniversary beer back in July. It was a Saison that had honey in it. There isn't necessarily anything about the name which would indicate if honey or some other product like that is used, but it is possible. Take for instance the beer style \"Milk Stout\", which utilizes lactose sugar. If we were to brew a beer like this it would be obvious in the name, but that isn't always the case.\r\n \r\nNone of our year-round beers utilize any animal products as ingredients or in the brewing process.\"\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2011-12-31T13:25:32.000-05:00","updated_on":"2011-12-31T13:34:34.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":821,"company_name":"Brewery De Konick","tag":"Brewery-De-Konick","address":"Mechelsesteenweg 291","city":"2018 Antwerpen","state":"","postal":"","country":"Belgium","phone":"(+32) (0)3/218.40.48","fax":"","email":"info@dekoninck.com","url":"www.dekoninck.com","checked_by":"Saralyn","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"Our beers do not contain any animal ingredients and we do not use animal products in the filtration or other processes.","created_on":"2009-12-11T02:45:00.000-05:00","updated_on":"2009-12-11T02:45:00.000-05:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"},{"id":417,"company_name":"Brewery Der Trappisten Van Westmalle","tag":"Brewery-Der-Trappisten-Van-Westmalle","address":"Antwerpsesteenweg 496","city":"B-2390 Westmalle","state":"","postal":"","country":"Belgium","phone":"+32 3 312 92 22","fax":"+32 3 312 92 28","email":"info@trappistwestmalle.be","url":"http://www.trappistwestmalle.be/en/page/brouwerij.aspx","checked_by":"Dagda","doubled_by":"Eric","notes":"UPDATE: February 2010\r\nCompany email from Merchant du Vin\r\n\"http://www.merchantduvin.com/pages/1_about/organic_vegan_glutenfree_beer_notes.pdf document is currant and correct - other than those of Traquair, no animal products including honey are used in any of our beers.\"\r\n\r\nThis status comes via the importer Merchant du Vin, who says:\r\n\"All our beers [are vegan].

Although our website states that our cask conditioned beers use isinglass, this is no longer true. A vegan substitute, Biofine Clear, is currently used to filter our cask beers. Here's some more info in case it's helpful:\r\n\r\nNone of our beers contain traces of milk, or corn. However, there is some residual sugar: glucose, maltose, and maltotriose. These sugars are derived from malted barley. We do not add sulfites as a preservative to our beer. Any sulfur formation is a result of the fermentation. Therefore, all of our beers are low in sulfites. Brooklyn Lager would be a good example of low sulfites, which has less than 1 ppm (the average sulfite content for wine is 80 ppm). Typically, sulfur dioxide levels in our beer are less than 1 ppm. The exceptions are Winter Ale, Black Chocolate Stout, Black Ops and Monster Ale, which have levels of 5-7 ppm of sulfur dioxide.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Lucky for you, we do not use isinglass in our filtering process, so none of our kegged or bottled beers have any animal products in them. A word to the wise though, if you happen to stop at a restaurant or our Brewery when we have casked beer, those do use isinglass so be sure not to have that (a cask is naturally carbonated beer that is aged. it looks like a smaller rounder keg turned on it's side with tap on one end).\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"The only beers we produce that contain any animal products are our cask-conditioned ales (on the handpump or direct from the cask), which contain isinglass.

We have four main beers that we brew year round. Of those, only our Backhand of God Stout is vegan (isinglass is used in the other three). Crannog Ales is a small Certified Organic Brewery in Sorrento, BC and is not manufactured anywhere else in the world!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (August 2012):\r\n\"We use Isinglass as a fining in all our beers EXCEPT the Backhand of God Stout. We do not use any animal ingredients in any of our beers otherwise, except for the occasional cask which uses honey, and which is stated on the beer. You are highly unlikely to get any cask ales from us anyway, so not to worry about it.\r\n \r\nWe respect all life, animal or vegetable. Our ethic is to live and brew in a way which supports a vital ecosystem, including livestock, wild animals, insects, soil biota, vegetation etc. We are aware that our lives depend on the lives of everything around us, regardless of class or family.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2012)\r\n- We are certified organic - all our beers, all the time. No non-organic ingredients.\r\n- We are fully committed to ethical and responsible farming and brewing. Our brewery is as close to zero-waste as current recycling availability allows, we have reduced our water use to 1/8 that of most breweries, and we re-use our wastewater on the farm. We have reduced packaging and re-use almost everything in the brewery. Both the farm and the brewery are certified organic, and our primary focus is to build and regenerate the eco-system within which we operate. We build soil through our brewery and farm processes.\r\n- We use isinglass as a processing aid in all our beers except the Backhand of God Stout. It is a processing aid that drops out of the beer before packaging, and is not present in the final beer.\r\n- We do not pasteurize or filter our beers, so that they remain live products with active yeast and all the flavour we work so hard to put there in the first place.\r\n- We use honey in some of our seasonal ales, indicated in the name or description of the beer. The honey comes from hives on the farm, which surrounds the brewery. (By the way, honey is produced by bees, it's not an \"animal\" ingredient. Just like wool is produced by sheep, they are not harmed in the shearing, and their health depends on being shorn annually!)\r\n- We continue to institute energy-saving methods in the brewery, from water re-use to heat-on-demand systems so that our footprint remains sustainable.\r\n- We raise livestock on the farm, as their manure and grazing assists in the creation of healthy soil and a viable eco-system. Without their input, our soil would become depleted and we would need to use chemical fertilizers! Responsible and ethical livestock rearing is extremely important to us. \r\n\r\nWe manufacture only in our own brewery, nowhere else. Why? Because the whole focus of what we do is sustainability, and exporting/outsourcing is simply not environmentally sustainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only beer that we make that adheres to your requirements would be the Backhand of God Stout, which uses no isinglass. It is widely available throughout southern BC - there's a list of where you can get it on our website.","created_on":"2012-03-31T08:37:47.000-04:00","updated_on":"2013-02-16T15:51:05.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":2560,"company_name":"Crate Brewery and Pizzeria","tag":"Crate-Brewery-and-Pizzeria","address":"Queen's Yard","city":"London Borough of Tower Hamlets, E9","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"info@cratebrewery.com","url":"www.cratebrewery.com","checked_by":"Kevin","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (November 2012):\r\n\"Unfortunately, we do use fish fining products to clarify the beer.

Please use the information below to determine whether or not you are comfortable with purchasing this product. ****\r\n\r\nNote from Manu (October 2012):\r\n\"I just discovered your amazing website and, checking the beers of my country, I found that there's some controversy about Estrella Damm being vegan or not. Since that's the most common beer in Catalunya and I'm vegan (and beer lover), I'd like to try to shed some light on the topic.\r\n\r\nIn the spanish \"foro vegetariano\" there was some topic about it (http://www.forovegetariano.org/foro/archive/index.php/t-35611.html) where one of the users got a direct answer from the company:\r\n\r\n\"En Damm para la fabricación de nuestras cervezas no se utilizan componentes ni aditivos de origen animal.\r\nDerivados del pescado, en forma de gelatinas o colas, se habían utilizado históricamente sobre todo en algunas cervecerías inglesas como clarificantes de la cerveza antes de la filtración pero hoy en día esta práctica está bastante abandonada ya que las técnicas de filtración han mejorado muchísimo.\r\nLa cerveza se obtiene a partir de la fermentación de un mosto gracias a levaduras de la familia Saccharomyces (hongo unicelular) que pueden estar presentes en el producto final en función del tipo de cerveza del que se trate (filtrada o sin filtrar).\r\n\r\nReciba un cordial saludo\r\nCristina Rios.\r\nRble. Calidad Exterior\r\nGRUPO DAMM\"\r\n\r\nTranslation (by myself):\r\n\r\n\"In Damm we don't use components or additives from animal origin for the manufacturing of our beers.\r\nFish derivates, in form of jellies or colas, were used historically, specially in some English breweries, as a beer clarifier before the filtering but nowadays this practice is quite abandoned since filtering techniques have evolved a lot.\r\nThe beer is obtained from the fermentation of a wort by yeast from the Saccharomyces family (unicellular fungus) which can be present in the final product depending on the type of beer in question (filtered or unfiltered).\"\r\n\r\nSo... It seems in the end Estrella Damm is vegan friendly (at least that's something, since they are not worker friendly at all... But I guess that's another story).\"\r\n\r\nNote from Ryan (August 2012):\r\n\"Okay, this is a little complicated. I can see where Miguel is coming from as it does almost seem to suggest that it MIGHT contain fish products, as the phrasing is awkward. \r\n\r\nEssentially what it says is \r\n\r\nFish and fish-based products, except\r\n\r\na. Fish gelatine used to carry vitamins or preparations of carotenoids\r\n\r\nb. Fish gelatine used as clarifier in beer or wine\r\n\r\nNow ordinarily I'd agree that this was something to be concerned about, but looking at the date of that it was from 2009, and I believe the other message you have on the website, which directly contradicts this, is more recent. It's a tricky one.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Miguel (July 2012):\r\n\"You have been change again this beer to Vegan friendly. It is wrong. You can find attached a certificate in which is written the opposite, but it is a bit tricky to understand, also in Spanish.\" [Correction (August 2013): This is in Catalan, not Spanish]\r\n\r\nCompany email (June 2012): (email sent to Estrella Damm)\r\n\"A Grup Damm no es fan servir derivats del peix ni altres additius d'origen animal. \r\nEls derivats del peix en forma de gelatines o colas s'havien fet servir històricament a cerveseria com a clarificants de la cervesa abans de la filtració. Avui en dia, aquesta pràctica està molt abandonada degut a que les tècniques de filtració han millorat moltíssim.\"\r\n\r\n[Translation by MC]: \"At Damm Group, products derived from fish and other additives of animal origin are not used. Fish derivatives in the form of gelatins or glues were formerly used to clarify the beer before filtration.

So here are some answers:\r\n1.  We do not use any animal products in any of our beers.\r\n2.  Our bottled beers available at the LCBO are Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Smashbomb Atomic IPA, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, Flying Monkeys Amber Ale, and Antigravity Light Ale.  \r\n3.  Our filters use diatemaceous earth (DE)--a filtration sand comprised of sedimentary rock which may contain the crushed skeletons of prehistoric critters. Is that bad? We do not use isinglass or gelatin.\r\n4.  We also us filtration powder that is DE and a powdery perlite (crushed alumino-silica rock or naturally occuring silicon dioxcide).\r\n5.  Our casks are unfiltered, and unless we call something a honey beer, there is no honey. We made a cask of Smash Jezebel HoneyBomb for C'est What? last spring, but it was just a one-off, specialty experiment which was a sweetened riff on our  Smashbomb Atomic IPA.  That's the only honey we've ever used.  Honestly, we didn't love it.\r\n6. We never use eggs.  \r\n7. We have never brewed a milk stout with lactose --the unfermentable sugar found in milk.  So NO to milk.\r\n8. We brew all our own beer, ourselves,  right here in downtown Barrie. None of our beers are contract brewed or produced off this premises.\r\n9.  We do have some new beers coming down the pipe with turbinado sugar, maple sugar, Madagascar Bourbob Vanilla pods, beers filtered through oak staves . . .  everything I'm thinking of  are all of plant-origins.  Hey, I'm thinking we're vegan!\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, we will soon (by mid 2012) be labelling all allergens in our beers.  Maybe a vegan notification might be useful, too.  If we have to design new labels, why not?\r\n\r\nHope this info was useful, and don't hesitate to ask more questions.  I do not know much about what counts as officially vegan, but I'm developing the idea that our beers are all natural and safe.  We do use varieties of organic hops and nonGMO'd malts.  Not all hop varieties are grown organically, but we try to get them whenever we can.\"\r\n\r\nMore details:\r\n\"None of our LCBO bottled beers have sugar in them.  Barley, hops, water, and yeast.  That's all. We get all our flavours from the varieties of hops and the different types of roast and malted barley or different strains of yeast. \r\n\r\nOf course, that being said, Antigravity has undergone a recipe tweaking recently, so I better check on it.  They're brewing a batch with a different, sweeter  malt, but I don't think anything else was added.  Adjunct or additives are not our style.   And, yes, we do brew a light ale --for slow-pitch softball and lawn mowing -- but the nice hoppy craftier brews you'd find at C'est What? are all vegan approved.  \r\n\r\nOf the beers in the LCBO, Hoptical Illusion Almost Pale Ale, Netherworld Cascadian Dark Ale, and Flying Monkeys Amber Ale are definitely vegan according to your criterion.  Smashbomb Atomic IPA would be vegan, too.  No adjunct or additives in Smashbomb --just buckets and buckets of hops!  You can get that one on tap in a lot of micro-friendly pubs.\r\n\r\nThe casks would be a different story and should be evaluated on a case by case basis.  Any info on Belgian Candi Sugar (yes, \"candi\" spelled with an \"i\"). It's brown and raw-looking, like hardened molassass, and it does have that rich molassass-y flavour.   C'est What? will be getting a 16-18%ABV Imperial Baltic Porter from us called Divinity in the next few weeks, and I know it has Belgian Candi Sugar in it to help get the alcohol content up there.  It tastes like a port --delicious!  The Belgian Candi Sugar is the only wild card for you in that one.  Hope you can drink it, because it is a whole new level in craft beer!\"","created_on":"2011-04-26T14:54:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-05-09T17:07:43.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":3148,"company_name":"Foolhardy Ales","tag":"Foolhardy-Ales","address":"118 Wellington Road","city":"Stockport","state":"","postal":"SK4 2LL","country":"England","phone":"0161 637 6191","fax":"","email":"foolhardyales@hotmail.com","url":"http://foolhardyales.co.uk","checked_by":"Andy","doubled_by":"","notes":"Note from Andy (December 2013):\r\n\"I visited The Hope pub in Stockport recently.

We have a 7 bbl brewery here and serve beer on site only (no distributing), although we do fill half-gallon jugs to go. \r\n \r\nThe only ingredients we use here are natural and we don't use honey (although we have considered it).  The ingredients that I have used up to this point are as follows:  barley, hops, yeast, water, Irish moss, and unpasteurized apple cider.\r\n \r\nWe don't filter our beer at all.  We use no isinglass, no gelatin, no bone char, etc.  If you are wondering about Irish moss, it is all natural, made from seaweed.  Irish moss \"is a species of red algae (Chondrus crispus) which grows abundantly along the rocky parts of the Atlantic coast of Europe and North America\". ( from Wikipedia)  We use Irish moss as a kettle coagulant.  Carageenan is the protein found in Irish moss which makes it useful to us brewers.  Carageenan carries a net negative charge on its particle.  Most of the proteins that leach out of the malted barley during the mashing process carry a net positive charge.  Adding Irish moss in the boil (the sweet liquid, wort, is boiled for stability and hop utilization) causes the positively charged proteins to coagulate together around the negatively charged carageenan particles.  This causes protein \"clumps\" to form which then have a much easier time falling to the bottom of the tank.  So, you could call Irish moss an all natural way to help clarify beer.  Every brewer I know uses it to some degree.\r\n \r\nAnyway, we at the Gardner Ale House take pride that our beer is not only all natural, but unfiltered as well, leaving the beer as wholesome and fresh as could possibly be.  Our beer might not always be perfectly clear as a result, but the flavor is unbeatable, and it is nice to know that we can call our beer vegan.  I hope this helps your list.  By the way, right now we have 6 of our own fresh house brews on tap: Facelift IPA, Oma's Altbier, Naked Stout, Snow Slaker Winter Lager, Summer's End Kolsch, and William Tell's Apple Ale.

I asked them very specifically about Guinness Extra Stout in the bottle and even sent them pictures of the back label with product codes on it. Even though the rep on the phone said that it was vegan friendly, the rep via email says they dont brew in New Brunswick and that they are not responsible for this beer. \r\n\r\nThey instructed me to contact DIAGEO. when i contacted DIAGEO (the proper distributor for this beer according to the label), they gave me the generic response that GUINNESS uses isinglass in their beer.

They have not gotten back to me yet.\r\n\r\nVery confusing info from Labatt's, but now i have in writing that they deny ownership of this specific product, even though the rep on the phone contradicted this information... annoying.\r\n\r\nHopefully DIAGEO responds with more info.\"\r\n\r\nNote from Matt (March 2013):\r\n\"The main confusion for me here is the fact that none of the packaging for Guinness in NA say Labbatt's brewing anywhere on it (also the Moosehead info which confuses things, cant even tell if they actually brew Guinness anymore), so i wanted to confirm what version of Extra Stout was brewed where.\r\n\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nI specifically asked Labatt's in the email about Guinness Extra stout in the bottle brewed by Guinness Brewing Company, New Brunswick, Canada (this is what's printed on the bottle label, there is no mention of Labatt's on the packaging at all, although they are the manufacturers).\r\n\r\nI received this email in response [see below] but it sounded very formulaic and didn't mention Guinness specifically. I called Labatt's to speak with a rep and at first they gave me the generic answer that they do in fact use isinglass in the process. Then I asked very clearly and specifically about bottled Extra Stout brewed and bottled in New Brunswick. After checking for me the rep was able to very clearly confirm that this product, brewed in New Brunswick, didn't not use isinglass in it's production and was in fact suitable for vegans. whew!\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (March 2013):\r\n\"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it. \r\n \r\nThe fine beers we brew (and import) are brewed with these all-natural ingredients:  water, barley malt, hops, yeast, and cereal grains.\r\n \r\nThe water we use is drawn from the municipal drinking supply and carbon filtered for astounding purity.  Our brewing water must free of any taste, color, or aroma before brewing.\r\n \r\nBarley malt is the “soul” of beer.  Our beers are brewed with pale two or six row barley malt.  Roasted barley gives the color to our beers – lightly roasted barley makes pale golden beers like Labatt Blue or Budweiser.  For Keith’s Red we use barley roasted a little longer, until the sugars start to caramelize.  Roast them yet more?  Keith’s Dark.\r\n \r\nHops are the female flower bud of a perennial climbing vine, and are known as the “spice” of beer.  Hops are added in different stages of the brew kettle’s boil to give the beer aroma, bitterness, and to balance the flavor. \r\n \r\nYeast is the life of the brewing process.  We use our own pure-cultured yeast strains for fermentation – the yeast breaks down sugars into carbon dioxide and alcohol.  Our lagers use a bottom-fermenting yeast for a crisper, cleaner flavor.  Ales use a top-fermenting yeast for a more fruity, floral, lingering notes.\r\n \r\nMost of our beers are also brewed with a cereal grain, also known as an adjunct.  Some are brewed with corn for a sweeter taste.  Some use rice for a crisp, clean finish. \r\n \r\nBeyond this, some beers use special flavorings or spices for a truly unique flavor – like the essence of lime found in Bud Light Lime, or the coriander and citrus peel found in Keith’s White.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2012):\r\n[from Labatt who brews Guiness Extra Stout in Canada] \"You will be pleased to hear that we do not use any animal products in our beer or the production of it.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (Feb 2012)\r\nI am writing to you in response to your recent email regarding whether Guinness and  it's suitability for Vegans.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your query however, we do use isinglass, a by product of the fishing industry, for fining all Guinness brewed beers. Isinglass is used widely in the brewing industry although it is extensively refined before use. Its sole purpose is as a fining agent to help remove yeast from our beer, while we accept that some minor traces of isinglass may subsequently remain in the finished product.\r\n\r\nWe are very happy with the technical performance of isinglass in removing yeast although we are conscious that its use may represent a barrier to consumption of our products to some. As part of our ongoing efforts to further improve the way we make our products, we are seeking alternatives to isinglass. To date, we have not found any alternative that is as effective and as environmentally friendly as isinglass for our product.\r\n\r\nCompany email (November 2011)\r\n\"In response to your inquiry, we would like to let you know that at this time, Guinness Black Lager is not suitable for vegetarians. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\"\r\n\r\nNote from William: March 2011 \r\n\"I know you have received conflicting information regarding the brewing of Guinness, and your level of exasperation is obvious from the Guinness entry.  Nonetheless, I tried to follow a logical thread that has been apparent from the beginning, when Guinness original explained that a certain product (Guinness Extra Stout for export to the U.S.) didn't use Isinglass as a fining agent and was vegan.  How could that be, I asked myself.  Well, I noticed that the Guinness Extra Stout was brewed in Canada.  So, I did some research and found that many of the online commentators at beer sites were wrong. Moosehead, not Labatt's, brewed it for the U.S.  \r\n\r\nThus, I contacted the actual brewers of Guinness Extra Stout that exported here, and their response follows: consumerinquiries@moosehead.ca\r\n\"Hello William,\r\nThank you for your inquiry. We do in fact brew delicious Guinness Extra Stout for export to the States right here in Canada’s most Irish city, Saint John.

All ingredients are natural and from\r\nplant sources. No materials of animal sources are used. We don't use products of animal origin in the refining and filrating\r\nprocess. All our beer is filtered through kieselguhr filters (the calciferous\r\nskeletons of diatoms). When we first received questions from our vegan\r\nconsumers, this lead us to investigate: is a diatom a single cell animal or\r\nis it a plant? The American dictionary of biology says : Diatoms contain chlorophyll and are photosyntetic. In older classifications\r\nthey are identified as primitive plants. Because they are indeed plant-like in many respects, it is still common practice to use the term \"plant\".\r\n(Biological Science; Keeton; 3rd ed.

Isinglass  has  been  used  in  beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning.  In keg and small pack beers, there  is  very  little,  if any finings left in the finished product as it settles  out  with  the  yeast,  and  any  residues  are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist  the  settling  of  the  live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning.  Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but  if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment  containing  the  majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,  fish  finings  work so well that all attempts by brewers to find  a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been  no  concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough  the  conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the  finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings that we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians.'\r\n\r\nWith  regards  to  our  ciders,  three  of  our products, Strongbow Sirrus, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material.

Many brewers use a isinglass, or other shellfish derivative, for clarifying purposes after the beer has fermented before bottling or kegging.  I have personally done a lot of research on the subject, not because of the vegan angle, but because i know a few people, including a cousin, that are deathly allergic to shellfish.  It turns out that most of the clarifying derivatives on the market are refined to the point that there are no actual shellfish proteins present, which would cause allergic reaction, only specific minerals which act to \"cling\" to remaining particulate in the beer and drop it from suspension.\r\nThis information comes from the Medical Research Director at Purdue University.  As such, I do not think anyone's vegan status or allergies would necessarily be compromised, but we have decided to just avoid the use altogether.  The complete ingredients for our flagships are as follows...\r\nFarm Girl Saison:  malted barley, hops, pure beet sugar, orange peel, irish moss, belgian yeast, and water. Pale Ale:  malted barley, hops, grapefruit peel, irish moss, american ale yeast, and water.\r\nWhile not \"organic\" (a term still suspect in food and brewing), we think we do a good job of only putting only pure, natural ingredients in our beer, avoiding chemicals and extract flavorings.","created_on":"2009-04-14T01:49:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2012-01-27T21:14:43.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":507,"company_name":"Lighthouse Brewing Company Inc","tag":"Lighthouse-Brewing-Company-Inc","address":"#2 836 Devonshire Road","city":"Victoria","state":"BC","postal":"V9A 4T4","country":"Canada","phone":"250-383-6500","fax":"250-383-0005","email":"info@lighthousebrewing.com","url":"http://www.lighthousebrewing.com/","checked_by":"Denyce","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\nHi there, unfortunately we use gelatin in our filtering process.

We are unusual even amongst microbreweries in that we do not fine beers (with isinglass) unless requested by the pub/outlet until the point of dispatch. Most breweries fine when they rack (fill casks). The problem lies not with us by the landlord of the outlet. Fined beer will settle within 24 hours of venting, and in some circumstances a quickly as 4 hours. Un-fined beers can take 72 hours but in any event 48 and very few pubs have sufficient stillage to allow for this. Think: a busy pub with say 8 hand pumps sell normally 32 x 9’s a week, they will typically have 16 stills for one ON and one SETTLING. If they went VEGAN they would need at least 24 and more sensibly 32: This is a logistical nightmare, never mind the cost, and space requirement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn the past year I have been asked ONCE about vegan beer for a beer festival, and beer festivals are even more complex as they usually only have 24 hours set-up time.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI sympathize with you but I also understand the commercial reality of running pubs, it’s also sad because un-fined beer has more “polish”.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Cheshire Cheese in Wallasey Village often take our beer un-fined as do Stamps Too in Waterloo, and I offer it to all new customers but few take it up and even fewer recognize any demand for vegan cask beer.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nI have recently had a visit form an American chemist who has a vegetable fining alternative, but it is twice the cost, so I don’t see any future here.\"","created_on":"2010-03-03T11:11:00.000-05:00","updated_on":"2010-03-03T11:11:00.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":1555,"company_name":"Lizard Ales","tag":"Lizard-Ales","address":"The Old Nuclear Bunker, Pednavounder","city":"Coverack, Helston","state":"Cornwall","postal":"TR12 6SE","country":"England","phone":"01326281135","fax":"","email":"lizardales@msn.com","url":"http://www.lizardales.co.uk/","checked_by":"Bones","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email:\r\n\"Yes - all of our bottled beers are suitable for vegans.

In addition, none of Anheuser-Busch brewed beers or other products contain any animal ingredients (such as milk, eggs, etc), or process aids such as isinglass or gelatin, except for two small volume brands: Budweiser \u0026 Clamato Chelada and Bud Light \u0026 Clamato Chelada.

For those reasons, I would absolutely consider all of our beers (other than Honey Lager and Honey Wheat) vegan friendly!\"\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2008):\r\n\"You asked about animal products.  We don't use animal derived products in our beers, nor as lubricant in the process equipment for making beer or our packaging materials.\r\n\r\nFinings, such as Isinglass, Irish Moss or gelatin, are commonly added to fermented beers to aid in the settling of yeast and other suspended particles. We do not use finings in our beers. We eliminate the need for finings by thoroughly settling and removing trub before fermentation. Additionally, the beechwood we add to our lagering tanks attracts and holds back the yeast. After a lengthy 3 weeks of aging, most yeast has well settled onto the beechwood at the bottom of the tank and will stay there when the beer moves forward. These are some of the techniques we use so that our beers can be all-Natural without the use of additives, stabilizers, preservatives or finings.\r\n\r\nAlso, none of our beers contain egg or dairy.  The only one of our beers that is brewed with honey is our Michelob Honey Lager.  We use natural light amber wildflower honey harvested in the Northern Plains and the Great Lakes areas of the United States.\"\r\n","created_on":"2008-07-02T23:45:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2014-01-22T16:56:29.000-05:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":1436,"company_name":"Michigan Brewing Company:","tag":"Michigan-Brewing-Company","address":"1093 Highview Drive","city":"Webberville","state":"MI","postal":"48892","country":"USA","phone":"(517) 521-3600","fax":"","email":"bob@michiganbrewing.com","url":"www.michiganbrewing.com","checked_by":"Tanya","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company Email:\r\n\"  Our beer products (Michigan Brewing Co., Celis and American Badass Beer brands) do not contain any animal ingredients nor are any animal products used in the processing or filtering of our products.\r\n\r\nWe are the sole manufacturer of the above brands.  \"","created_on":"2011-04-20T16:00:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-04-20T16:00:00.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"},{"id":337,"company_name":"Mickey's","tag":"Mickeys","address":"","city":"Milwaukee","state":"WI","postal":"","country":"USA","phone":"","fax":"","email":"","url":"http://www.mickeys.com/","checked_by":"Kameron","doubled_by":"Douglass","notes":"Company email (September 2011):\r\n\r\n\"MillerCoors does not use any animal by-products in our brewing process, nor are there any animal sources used in our packaging.

We try to treat our yeast as humanely as possible - creating the most favorable conditions we can for good healthy reproduction during primary fermentation. However, once fermentation is complete, it's a different story. Cold temperatures are used to limit the activity of the yeast and encourage it to settle out in order to clear the products. Once clarity has been achieved, the product is racked off into another vessel and the yeast is discarded. Much of this yeast will still be alive, just in a subdued state. The unwanted yeast is introduced to an active composting system where it would die - probably with a couple of days. I'm not really sure if this is cruel or not - it's a very hard one to judge.

Isinglass has been used in beers for centuries as a clarification agent during beer conditioning. In keg and small pack beers, there is very little, if any finings left in the finished product as it settles out with the yeast, and any residues are removed during the filtration process.\r\n\r\nIn cask beers, however, finings is added to the beer when it is packaged to assist the settling of the live yeast that is an integral part of cask conditioning. Cask beers, then, will always have some finings in the cask, but if the beer has been treated properly in the pub and isn't cloudy, the sediment containing the majority of finings remains at the bottom of the cask and very little carries through to the finished product.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, fish finings work so well that all attempts by brewers to find a suitable alternative have by and large been unsuccessful. There has been no concern over health aspects, as no consumer ill effects have ever been reported over the many, many years that finings have been used.\r\n\r\nAlthough the conclusion drawn is that there is little, if any, finings in the finished product, it is advised that as the product may contain traces of finings we do not say it is suitable for vegetarians/vegans.\r\nThank you for your interest in Heineken USA.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nHeineken USA Consumer Affairs\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Although  Scottish  \u0026  Newcastle  UK products are not tested on animals, we treat our beers (this includes Newcastle Brown in can, bottle and keg) with isinglass finings (a solution of collagen prepared from certain fish).\"","created_on":"2006-08-30T23:55:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2011-03-01T14:12:30.000-05:00","status":"Not Vegan friendly","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":527,"company_name":"Niagara's Best Beer","tag":"Niagaras-Best-Beer","address":"75 St. Paul Street","city":"St. Catharines","state":"ON","postal":"L2R 3M3","country":"Canada","phone":"(905) 684-5998","fax":"(905) 684-1399","email":"hophead@sympatico.ca","url":"http://niagarasbestbeer.com/","checked_by":"Tom","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email:\r\n\r\nAs a vegetarian myself, I am keenly aware of ingredients in the food I eat, and I can assure you that both of our beers contain only water, malted barley and/or wheat, hops and yeast.

I'm pretty sure this is a new addition to their line but thought you may want to update Rogue's listing on the Barnivore site.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (July 2011):\r\n\r\n\"Rogue products use no animal products with the\r\nexception of one beer--Somer Orange Honey Wheat. We most likely will be discontinuing this product next year.\"\r\n\r\nNicole writes:\r\n\"I called today and can't remember who I talked to.  She said that all of their filtered beers are filtered through diatomaceous earth, which she thought was not vegan....  I will accept DE as vegan personally, because it's millions of years old, but I didn't get into it with her.... She also said they have many unfiltered beers, but they make no guarantees, because they may need to run them through a light filter step as well.\r\nShe also said they make no guarantees that they might not choose later to use other animal based filtering methods.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\n\"Drink up!

She didn't give me details, but said all their beer is not vegan, if you'd like to update.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: Oct 2010\r\n\"At our brewpub we use gelatin to fine our beers, none of the gelatin remains in the beer but none the less, we use gelatin.

Also, any beer out for distribution from the brewery, such as beers on tap at Toronado do not have gelatin as they would have been made at the production brewery where we filter everything.  At our pub is just isn’t cost effective or labor effective to run a filter and honestly, the gelatin does a better job as it leaves more flavor behind.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email:\r\nUPDATE: KevinM\r\n\"that the draft offerings of Blind Pig, Damnation and Pliny the Elder that get served in Philly are also vegan.  (Not too many other areas outside of CA get kegs of Russian River)\r\nYay, this is so exciting (Pliny the Elder is considered by most to be the best example of that style - Imperial/Double IPA)\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE: JULY 2009 via KevinM\r\n\" Russian River started out as a small brewpub.  At the brewpub they use gelatin to fine all of the beers for clarification purposes.  This year, they started a production brewery to go along with the brewpub.  They were able to score a nice centrifuge (big machine that spins the beer around to get the yeast out) for this.  At that production facility they make Pliny the Elder (Double IPA), Blind Pig (IPA), and Damnation (Belgian Golden Strong Ale).  They bottle those beers and distribute them all over the country.  However, they also keg those beers (kegged =\u003E served on tap) and ship them to a few select markets outside of California.  (Philadelphia being one of them - yay for me!)   There's a good chance most other markets outside of California, Philly, and NYC don't even get draft Russian River stuff.\r\n\r\nSo....\r\n\r\nBlind Pig, Damnation, and Pliny the Elder on draught in bars, or in bottles = good\r\nAnything else (primarily only in bottles - these are barrel aged mostly sour beers) = bad\r\nAnything served in their brewpub in California = bad\r\n\r\nHere's the email I got from Vinnie on Friday:\r\nKevin,\r\nYes, the draft that makes it out to Philly is run through the centrifuge as\r\nwell.\r\nVinnie\"\r\n\r\nUPDATE:  JULY 2009 via Nicole\r\n\"The bottles of Blind Pig IPA Pliny the Elder, and Damnation do not employ gelatin in the production process.  They are ALWAYS made at our production brewery where we make beer in larger quantities and thus use a centrifuge to remove the yeast and not gelatin, we end up with the same results as we do at the pub where we use the gelatin.\" \r\n\r\nDECEMBER 2007\r\n\"Unfortunately, I use gelatin in all of our beers to fine them.

Gutweed (Enteromorpha intestinalis) Hijiki or Hiziki (Sargassum fusiforme) Irish moss (Chondrus crispus) ... an seadible seaweed.\r\n\r\nFor filtration we use: Diatomaceous Earth, explained below:\r\nDiatomaceous earth (pronounced /?da?.?t??me???s ??r?/) also known as diatomite or kieselgur, is a naturally occurring, soft, siliceous sedimentary rock that is easily crumbled into a fine white to off-white powder. It has a particle size ranging from less than 1 micron to more than 1 millimeter, but typically 10 to 200 microns.[1]  This powder has an abrasive feel, similar to pumice powder, and is very light, due to its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of oven dried diatomaceous earth is 80 to 90% silica, with 2 to 4% alumina (attributed mostly to clay minerals) and 0.5 to 2% iron oxide.[1]\r\n\r\nDiatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It is used as a filtration aid, as a mild abrasive, as a mechanical insecticide, as an absorbent for liquids, as cat litter, as an activator in blood clotting studies, and as a component of dynamite. As it is also heat-resistant, it can be used as a thermal insulator.\r\n\r\nDiatoms[1]  are a major group of eukaryotic algae, and are one of the most common types of phytoplankton.\r\n\r\nPhytoplankton are the autotrophic  component of the plankton community. The name comes from the Greek words ????? (\"phyton\"), or \"plant\", and ???????? (\"planktos\"), meaning \"wanderer\" or \"drifter\".\r\n\r\nAnd finally, but not last, when we just want to clarify a beer without filtration we use a beer clarifying agent called Biofine Clear A3 also sold by Brewers Supply Group manufactured by Kerry. Biofine Clear A3 is a purified collodial solution of silicic acid (SiO2) in water. It has been specially formulated for the rapid sedimentation of yeast and other haze forming particles in beer.\"\r\n\r\nCompany Email: March 2010\r\n\"Here at the Utah Brewers Co-op we use no products that are animal derived in any of our bottled or draft beers. That includes the Full line of Squatters and Wasatch beers.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email: June 2007\r\n\"I can only speak for the beers i produce at my pub regarding their vegan status, because i do not know all the techniques of the other local brewers. My hefewiezen, pilsner, vienna and cask are the only vegan beers we have on tap all the time. I guess if i felt their was a larger demand for a variety of vegan beers i would make more of them. I use finnings to clarify my ales, and as you mentioned, this inhibits them from being vegan. If i do not clarify my beers, the yeast not only makes them cloudy and unpresentable, but it also creates an unpleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nWith that said, you will be happy to know that my assistant is also vegan and has showed great interest in find other ways to clarify our ales with something vegan friendly.

In fact, our former Head Brewer of nine years was in fact a vegan!\r\n\r\nDouble Check email:\r\nYou will be pleased to know that our beer is 100% vegan compatible.  So there's no need to defect to a lesser beer.  The fining agent we use for our beer is a protein-binding agent derived from kelp.  No cow hooves, no fish guts, no bad karma points for you.

The only animal product which will find its way into any of our beers is piscine isinglass.\r\n\r\nAs far as cask beers go: While some brewers manage to avoid the use of isinglass by relying on a highly flocculent yeast or by sending beer out with rather low levels of residual yeast, we've found that neither of these approaches will give us beer that reliably conditions in cask and suits normal cellar operations.  Basically, we've found it pretty near impossible to sell pale, cask-conditioned beer unfined, so we do normally use isinglass in these products. On the other hand, our darker beers work well without finings, so we don't put any in, making them suitable for everyone, including vegetarians and vegans.\r\n\r\nThe cask beers of ours I'd suggest would be the \"No. 2 Stout\" or the \"Dark Country\".  And possibly other, occasional beers, which we'd identify on our website as being suitable for vegans.\r\n\r\n Regarding bottled beers: We're planning to start marketing a small range of bottle-conditioned beer and we hope that these will all be  unfined. At present our two filtered, carbonated beers are the \"IPA\" and the \"Dry Stout\".  Of these, the \"Dry Stout\" is unfined, hence suitable for vegans.\r\n \r\nAny utensils or containers that may have been in contact with isinglass will, as a matter of course, be cleaned thoroughly after such use, and before being used for anything else.\r\n\r\nWe're always looking to improve our products, and for me this would include moving away from the use of isinglass where we can.\"","created_on":"2011-06-01T06:49:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2012-03-25T09:40:40.000-04:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"},{"id":81,"company_name":"Strongbow - UK","tag":"Strongbow-UK","address":"","city":"","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"","fax":"","email":"consumercare@heineken.co.uk","url":"","checked_by":"Sarah","doubled_by":"Ross, Michael, Liam, Katharina, Bones, Anna, Sam","notes":"Company email (January 2013):\r\n\"While the majority of our ciders including Strongbow Pear do not have any animal derived ingredients there is a possibility of carryover from some of our ciders that do, therefore we do not claim that any of our ciders are vegetarian.\r\nStrongbow Pear is currently only produced by Heineken UK.\"\r\n\r\nCompany email (October 2012):\r\n\"With regards to our ciders, two of our products, Bulmers Original and Jacques use an animal product as a colouring material.

I've got good news and bad news in relation to what I call the \"vegan\" question.\r\n\r\nOur Wheat, Weizen, Maibock, Oktoberfest, Winter Warmer, Saison and upcoming Lambic series are all vegan friendly.\r\n\r\nHowever, in order to clarify our Pale, IPA, Porter and Amber it necessitates the use of isinglass because we do not filter our beer. Isinglass is composed of the swim bladders of a specific type of fish, which helps bond to other proteins and settles out during our conditioning phase. No noticeable flavor changes occur with the use of isinglass, and the actual amount that ends up in the bottle and keg is less than one part per billion. That's the best explanation I can give in defense of our use in relation to these four brews affecting a vegan or vegetarian diet. Honestly, ketchup probably contains a similar amount of unintentional insect parts as part of its finished product.\r\n\r\nOther clarifying agents that can be used involve either silica gels or plastic based media that are not digestible and not something we choose to use on this basis. If we ever move to filtration, isinglass we most likely become a thing of the past, but many arguments exist for unfiltered beer being the most flavorful and colorful traditionally crafted in the market.\r\n\r\nIt's a fun subject for me, and I've had several friendly arguments at festivals and bars when this question comes up.\r\n\r\nI'm always happy to relay that the Wheat, our biggest seller, is vegan.

Of interest is the collagen (protein) in such process aids.  The most common comes from certain fish, and is called isinglass.  For the same clarification purpose some brewers also use gelatin, which is less effective but easier to use than isinglass.  When using isinglass or gelatin, it is likely that only very small amounts of those compounds carryover into the finished beer.\r\nWidmer products do not contain isinglass or gelatin.  We receive quite a few questions on this topic and accordingly try to avoid using gelatin in any of our products, even the experimentals, but one exception is a beer that we produce in small volumes, called KGB Russian Stout, that on occasion contains gelatin.  Additionally, some beers that Widmer brews for charity under the Collaborator brand name contain gelatin.  The Collaborator products are not Widmer products, and are only available in the Portland, Oregon market, and in keg only. \r\nIn addition to the fining agents we have two brands that contain lactose, which is isolated and purified from whey. Depending on one's viewpoint a sugar, like lactose, that is isolated and purified from a dairy product, such as whey, may or may not be considered vegetarian or vegan.  If you are sensitive to this concept you should probably avoid Drop Top Amber and definitely avoid Snow Plow Milk Stout (aka Milk Stout).  DTA contains very little lactose, Snow Plow contains slightly less lactose than milk. One other possible exception is our use of milk sugar in Drop Top Amber ale.  I believe the milk sugar, otherwise known as lactose, is isolated from whey.  Whey comes from milk curds. \r\nA few consumers may consider diatoms animals or animal products so be advised that any filtered Widmer product used diatomaceous earth as the filter media.  Some consumers also consider yeast to be an animal, so be advised that any unfiltered Widmer product will contain live yeast cells, particularly our Hefeweizen.\"","created_on":"2006-09-01T00:41:00.000-04:00","updated_on":"2010-03-22T10:48:42.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":3047,"company_name":"Wild Card Brewery","tag":"Wild-Card-Brewery","address":"","city":"East London","state":"","postal":"","country":"England","phone":"07982402650","fax":"","email":"http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/contact-us.html","url":"http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk","checked_by":"Thom","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (September 2013):\r\n\"Our bottle conditioned beer is suitable for vegetarians, in cask it is not.\"\r\n","created_on":"2013-10-03T21:52:32.000-04:00","updated_on":"2013-10-03T21:52:32.000-04:00","status":"Has Some Vegan Options","red_yellow_green":"Yellow"},{"id":3117,"company_name":"Wild Cider","tag":"Wild-Cider","address":"","city":"","state":"","postal":"","country":"Ireland","phone":"","fax":"","email":"handcraftedptyltd@gmail.com","url":"","checked_by":"Roey","doubled_by":"","notes":"Company email (November 2013):\r\n\"Our cider is made in Ireland only and has no animal products used in the process.\"\r\n\r\n","created_on":"2013-12-01T20:03:17.000-05:00","updated_on":"2013-12-01T20:03:17.000-05:00","status":"Vegan Friendly","red_yellow_green":"Green"},{"id":3137,"company_name":"Wild Fox Wines","tag":"Wild-Fox-Wines","address":"PO Box 343","city":"Prospect","state":"SA","postal":"5082","country":"Australia","phone":"(08) 8342 5321","fax":"(08) 8342 5323","email":"sales@wildfoxwines.com","url":"http://www.wildfoxwines.com/","checked_by":"Jen","doubled_by":"Sarah","notes":"Company email (December 2013):\r\n\"The Franks Apple and Pear Summer Ciders are Vegan Friendly.

We think it is important for people to know about their food and drinks and how it is made.  Surprisingly enough, we are forbidden - by law- to put any kind of ingredient or nutritional label on our beers.  Breweries aren't governed by the FDA. The macro breweries lobbied the Federal Government very strongly in favor of not putting ingredient/nutritional labels on beer.  Crazy but true.  I guess they don't want people to know about all the chemicals, etc. that they put in their beers.  So, the answer to your question is - no, we do not use any animal products or byproducts in our beers.
